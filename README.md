# Too Long - line limit

Create clean and readable code in Visual Studio Code.

## Features

The extension encourages you to write short lines of code, notifying you when you exceed the limit.
Two limits are built in:

- `soft limit` (default 80 characters) - exceeding it results in a warning,
- `hard limit` (default 120 characters) - exceeding it results in an error.

## Extension Settings

* `too-long-line-limit.softLimit`: Limit of the number of characters, after which a warning will be displayed.
* `too-long-line-limit.hardLimit`: Limit of the number of characters, after which a error will be displayed.
